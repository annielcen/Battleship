# Battleship
Battleship Project (Midterm Project STATS 102A)

Grade Recieved: 90/100

I implemented my ai_305721672 player inspired by the probability density algorithm creating a probability grid to find which squares on the gameboard are most likely to have a ship based on ocean dimesions and opponent ship sizes.

### Errors made:
I read the instructions wrong and implemented my ai_305721672 with the arguments ocean, history, and size, when they should've been omitted which caused my player to be unable to run in the tournament code.
